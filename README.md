# DeepImmuno
Deep-learning empowered prediction and generation of immunogenic epitopes for T cell immunity. 

We recommend to try out our web application for that: https://deepimmuno.research.cchmc.org/

The repository for building the DeepImmuno web server: https://github.com/frankligy/DeepImmuno-web

- Please refer to [DeepImmuno-CNN](#deepimmuno-cnn) if you want to predict immunogenicity

- Please refer to [DeepImmuno-GAN](#deepimmuno-gan) if you want to generate immunogenic peptide

- Please refer to [Train your own GAN](https://github.com/frankligy/DeepImmuno/tree/main/extension) if you want to generate peptides with customized features/properties.

Enjoy and don't hesitate to ask me questions (contact at the bottom), I will be responsive! Feel free to raise an issue on github page!

## FAQ
1. **Why I get zero immunogenicity score when running on deepimmno webserver?**
Currently, Deepimmuno-CNN only supports peptides in the length of 9 and 10. We are working on adding support to peptides of other length and it will be available in the future version. But for now, it is advisable to filter to your queried peptides to 9mer and 10mer. 

## DeepImmuno-CNN

#### Dependencies

python = 3.6

tensorflow = 2.3.0

numpy = 1.18.5

pandas = 1.1.1


- *Note: This is the enviroment that I used for development and I also tested it. But as long as you use python > 3, tensorflow = 2.3, It should also work.*

#### How to use?

If you want to query a single epitope (peptide + HLA), for example you want to query peptide _**HPPLMNVER**_ along with _**HLA-A*0201**_. You need to

```shell
python3 deepimmuno-cnn.py --mode "single" --epitope "HPPLMNVER" --hla "HLA-A*0201"
```

If you want to query multiple epitopes, you just need to prepare a csv file like this:

```shell
AAAAAAAAA,HLA-A*0201
CCCCCCCCC,HLA-B*5801
DDDDDDDDD,HLA-C*0702
```

Then you run:

```shell
python3 deepimmuno-cnn.py --mode "multiple" --intdir "/path/to/above/file" --outdir "/path/to/output/folder" --outname "outname.txt"
```

- *Please note, when you specify the output dir, don't include the forward slash at the end, for example, use "/Desktop" instead "/Desktop/"*

- *PLease note, if python3 doesn't work, you can replace python3 to python, it depends your installed python interpreter*

A full help prompt is as below:

```
usage: deepimmuno-cnn.py [-h] [--mode MODE] [--epitope EPITOPE] [--hla HLA]
                         [--intdir INTDIR] [--outdir OUTDIR] [--outname OUTNAME]

DeepImmuno-CNN command line

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --mode MODE        single mode or multiple mode
  --epitope EPITOPE  if single mode, specifying your epitope
  --hla HLA          if single mode, specifying your HLA allele
  --intdir INTDIR    if multiple mode, specifying the path to your input file
  --outdir OUTDIR    if multiple mode, specifying the path to your output folder
  --outname OUTNAME  if multiple mode, specifying the name of the output file
```

## DeepImmuno-GAN

#### Dependencies

python = 3.6

pytorch = 1.4.0

numpy = 1.18.4

pandas = 1.0.5


- *Note: This is the enviroment that I used for development and I also tested it. But as long as you use python > 3, pytorch = 1.4, It should also work.*


#### How to use

Pretty simple, just run like this

```shell
python3 deepimmuno-gan.py --outdir "/path/to/store/output"
```

It will automatically genearte one batch, which is **64** pseudo-immunogenic peptides of **HLA-A*0201** for your. It is worth noting that, because of the way I encode the peptide, there will be a placeholder "-". 

A full help prompt is as below
```
usage: deepimmuno-gan.py [-h] [--outdir OUTDIR]

DeepImmuno-GAN to generate immunogenic peptide

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --outdir OUTDIR  specifying your output folder
```

- *Please note, when you specify the output dir, don't include the forward slash at the end, for example, use "/Desktop" instead "/Desktop/"*

- *PLease note, if python3 doesn't work, you can replace python3 to python, it depends your installed python interpreter*
